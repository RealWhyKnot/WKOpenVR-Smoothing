// Heartbeat thread. Started in ServerTrackedDeviceProvider::Init, joined in
// Cleanup. Every 5 seconds it logs an "alive" line plus a snapshot of every
// hook-fire counter. Two diagnostic purposes:
//   1. Confirm the DLL stays loaded long-term. SteamVR logs DLL_PROCESS_DETACH
//      ~1s after Init returns (same pattern SpaceCalibrator's log shows in
//      production), but a continuing heartbeat after that "unloaded" line
//      proves the DLL is still in vrserver.exe's address space.
//   2. Show which hooks are actually catching traffic. Zero-counts on every
//      IVRDriverInput method while pose-hook counts climb is the smoking gun
//      for the per-driver-wrapper hypothesis.
